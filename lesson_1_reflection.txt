How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It demonstrates the location of bug and save user's time to clear complex relation between codes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We could track our old algorithm and data structure to figure out the current version is actually suitable for recent real situation.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It may save the typo or misfunction changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    If multiple file changes, Git would save it separately.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log for view listing of changes, git diff to compare the changes in different history.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We could have many undo button to check error statement or operation.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For current course practice.
