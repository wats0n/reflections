When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Collaborate with other people in the same time.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Eliminate the un-desire modification automatically update to public online repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    When copy repository on Github, use fork.
    When download to local and automatically set up remote repository, use clone.
    When create new feature or do some experimental changes, use branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Reduce merging effort on code management. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Update and fix source is easier, pull request (merge request) is harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Change in master is fast, but we may need branch to collaborate with other people in parallel by branch.
